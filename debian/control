Description: DNS protocol library for Go
 Complete and usable DNS library. All widely used Resource Records
 are supported, including the DNSSEC types. It follows a lean and
 mean philosophy.  If there is stuff you should know as a DNS
 programmer there isn't a convenience function for it. Server side
 and client side programming is supported, i.e. you can build
 servers and resolvers with it.
